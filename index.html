        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently working at a startup gaming company called WhatIsland Networks. WhatIsland Networks primarily focuses on micro-transactions through video games such as Minecraft by creating plugins. Through these micro-transactions, the company will be able to build its own platform and open more servers in order to create games of their own. I work in the marketing department and I am in charge of running all of their social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. I have been with this company since it became a company in the beginning of February. 
<br><br>

        I am also currently the President of the Math and Reading Club for elementary students at Glenn L. Martin Elementary School. It is a nonprofit organization founded by myself in order to promote and emphasize the importance of education within the local Santa Ana community. Many schools in Santa Ana suffer from lack of sufficient funding and resources, which leads to a trickle down effect to students. Students who struggle with poverty and also a school that is not sufficiently funded tend to find the lack of a need for education and change their priorities. At the Math and Reading Club, we primarily focus on elementary school students and help students with extra tutoring sessions in a small classroom setting. Classrooms hold around 5 to 6 kids and the session is about 3 hours long. It is held on Saturday morning from 9 am to 12 am. We not only help kids with their studies, but also their study habits. Making small adjustments in the way they study helps improve their abilities in test taking and ultimately makes them better students. As President of the Math and Reading club, I began the funding of our elementary schools by raising monthly garage sales. The community brings used washed clothing items to the Orange Canaan Presbyterian Church, which is located right across the street of the elementary school, and volunteers help set up the garage sale. EVery month, the profits range from one thousand dollars to two thousand dollars. The profits earned from this fundraising event are donated to Martin Elementary School. The money had been used in providing new and updated textbook material and resources. Additionally, the money has been used for funding school field trips and after school programs. <br><br>

        Previously, I have been interning at Laserfiche. Laserfiche is a privately owned software development company that creates enterprise content management, business process automation, workflow, records management, document imaging and web form software. I worked directly under the President Karl Chan on the marketing floor and given the responsibility of working under a certain timeline. Each day, I was tasked with learning the basics of coding and worked within a team for the WorkFlow Management Project. The WorkFlow Management Project was created in order to ensure an efficient work environment for companies in order to prevent any wasted time. It proved to me a huge success and my team and I eventually would promote our idea at the Gartner Convention of 2015.
